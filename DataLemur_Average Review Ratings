Given the reviews table, write a query to get the average stars for each product every month.

The output should include the month in numerical value, product id, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. 
Sort the output based on month followed by the product id.





WITH cte_average
AS
(
SELECT date_part('month',submit_date) AS mth,product_id AS product, AVG(stars) AS avg_stars
FROM reviews
GROUP BY date_part('month',submit_date),product_id
)
SELECT mth,product,ROUND(avg_stars,2)
FROM cte_average
ORDER BY mth,product
