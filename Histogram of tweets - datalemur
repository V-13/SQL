Assume you are given the table below containing tweet data. Write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. 
Output the tweet count per user as the bucket, and then the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	integer
msg	string
tweet_date	timestamp


Solution

WITH cte_count
AS
(
SELECT user_id,COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_count
FROM tweets
WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2022/01/01' AND '2022/12/31'
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT tweet_count AS tweet_bucket,COUNT(user_id) AS user_num
FROM cte_count
GROUP BY tweet_count
