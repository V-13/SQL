Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021,
write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year 
and last post of the year in the year 2021. 
Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

WITH post_count_CTE 
AS
(
SELECT user_id,COUNT(post_id) AS post_count FROM posts
WHERE post_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT posts.user_id,EXTRACT(DAY FROM MAX(post_date)-MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
FROM posts JOIN post_count_CTE
ON posts.user_id = post_count_CTE.user_id
WHERE post_count > 1
GROUP BY posts.user_id
